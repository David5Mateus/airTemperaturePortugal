# Air Temperature Portugal

## Description

This project aims to work with data containing the air temperature in Portugal from 1992 to 2022. The data is extracted from [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) and stored in a nc file. The data is then processed and plotted in order to visualize the air temperature in Portugal.
